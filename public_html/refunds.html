										<h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
									</header>
									<p>We understand that plans can change unexpectedly, and we strive to accommodate our guests as best as we can. However, to ensure the smooth operation of our experiences and the satisfaction of all our guests, we have implemented the following cancellation policy:</p>
									
									<h5>Cancellation with Less Than 48 Hours Notice:</h5>
									<p>If a cancellation is made with less than 48 hours notice before the scheduled reservation time, a cancellation fee of 50% of the booking charge will be applied.</p>
									<p>We will refund 50% of the amount paid for the booking.</p>
									<h5>Cancellation with Less Than 24 Hours Notice:</h5>
									<p>Unfortunately, if a cancellation is made with less than 24 hours notice from the start time of your reservation, we are unable to offer any refund. This is due to the preparation involved, including ordering food items, decorations, and arranging transportation for your experience.</p>
									<h5>Rescheduling:</h5>
									<p>We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and we are happy to accommodate rescheduling requests made at least 48 hours in advance. However, a rebooking fee may be charged based on the circumstances if rescheduling requests are made less than 48 hours before your booking.</p>
									<h5>Reservation Duration:</h5>
									<p>Reservations are scheduled for a maximum of 2 hours unless otherwise agreed upon. We kindly ask for your understanding and cooperation in adhering to the agreed-upon duration.</p>
									<h5>Late Arrival:</h5>
									<p>We offer a 30 minute grace period for reservations. If you anticipate being late for your reservation, please notify us as soon as possible. However, if you fail to show up within 30 minutes of your scheduled reservation time without prior notice, we reserve the right to cancel your reservation with no refund.</p>
									<h5>Weather:</h5>
									<p>In the event that inclement weather prevents us from delivering the experience you've booked with us, we're fully prepared to accommodate you in the following ways:</p>
									<p>Refund Option: If the weather makes it impossible or unsafe to proceed with your booking, we are happy to provide you with a full refund for your purchase. Your satisfaction is paramount, and we want to ensure you're not inconvenienced in any way.</p>
									<p>Rescheduling: Alternatively, if you prefer, we can reschedule your booking for another date or time that suits you better. Our team will work closely with you to find the most convenient alternative to ensure you still get to enjoy the experience.</p>
									<h5>Agreement:</h5>
									<p>By making a booking with us, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of our cancellation policy outlined above. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us. We look forward to providing you with an unforgettable experience!</p>									
									<p>Warm regards,</p>
									<p>Wanderluxe, LLC</p>
